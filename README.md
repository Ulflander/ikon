# ikon

Micro framework to complement [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/).

It provides the following features under the namespace `ikon`:

- Routing (using [Rlite](https://github.com/chrisdavies/rlite))
- A very simple but yet powerful view instanciator
- Cookies (using [Cookie Monster](https://github.com/jgallen23/cookie-monster))
- A few jQuery-like functions (ajax, extend, hasClass...)

## TODO

- Documentation
